Hi!
My name is Danielle, and I’m a third-year Computer Science major at UC Davis with a strong passion for public affairs, tech policy, and product management. I’m driven by the ways technology can be used to create meaningful, ethical, and socially impactful solutions to real-world challenges.
Through my coursework, projects, and involvement in organizations like TedxUCDavis and Women in Computer Science, I’ve gained hands-on experience in designing and developing web applications, optimizing user interactions, and improving accessibility. I love combining technical skills with thoughtful design and policy awareness to create systems that are both innovative and responsible.
I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate, innovate, and grow at the intersection of technology, policy, and sustainability.
